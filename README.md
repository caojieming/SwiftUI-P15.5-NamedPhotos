# SwiftUI-P15.5-NamedPhotos
Hacking With Swift Day 77 Milestone (projects 13-15)

An app that asks users to import a picture from their photo library, then attach a name to whatever they imported. The full collection of pictures they name are shown in a List, and tapping an item in the list shows a detail screen with the full picture and the map location of where the item was saved.

List of Features:
- Uses PhotosPicker to let users import a photo from their photo library.
- Detects when a new photo is imported, and immediately ask the user to name the photo.

- Shows all names and photos in a list, sorted by name.
- Creates a detail screen that shows a picture full size and the map location of where you made that save.
